## How to Compile & Run

### Windows

If [CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) is installed, open the project solution and press "Build and run" (or press the `F9` key)

**Note**

_If an error is returned on build and run, close CodeBlocks and reopen. Sometimes the IDE doesn't behave properly with the program but if you use the executable in `/bin/debug/` it will run fine from a command line._

### MacOS / Linux

```bash
$ g++ -Wall main.cpp -o 377_project
$ ./377_project
```
